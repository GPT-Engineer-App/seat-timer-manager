# seat-timer-manager

A seat management timer application designed for managing occupancy and time spent at desks or seats in offices, libraries, or cafes. The application should feature an intuitive interface for users to check-in and check-out of seats, displaying the current status of seat availability. It should include a timer function to limit and track the duration a seat is occupied. The app could provide alerts or notifications when the occupancy time is nearing its end, and offer an administrative view to monitor usage statistics and manage seat allocations. The design should be minimalistic, focusing on ease of use and clarity in displaying information.
